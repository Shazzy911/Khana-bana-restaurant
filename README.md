Restaurant Reservation & Online Food Ordering Application Semester Project Proposal & Report

1. Introduction
   Restaurant Reservation & Online Food Ordering Application involves creating a comprehensive platform that allows users to reserve tables, order food online, and manage their accounts. Its purpose is to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience for food enthusiasts, casual diners, and anyone in between. The objective of this project is to develop a fully functional application utilizing Next.js with Typescript for the front-end, Express.js and Node.js for the back-end, Prisma as the ORM, and additional technologies such as Next-Auth for authentication, Stripe for payment processing, and React Query for caching.
2. System Requirements
   Functional Requirements:
   • User registration and login
   • Restaurant browsing by location, cuisine, or personalized recommendations
   • Table reservation and management
   • Food ordering with standard controls
   • Order management and tracking
   • User profiles and settings
   • Search functionality for restaurants or dishes
   • Social features such as sharing orders and following other users
   • Real-time order updates using (link unavailable)
   Non-Functional Requirements:
   • Responsiveness and user-friendliness across various devices
   • Efficient loading times and smooth navigation
   • Scalability to accommodate increasing users and data
   • Security measures including secure user authentication and data encryption
3. Technology Stack
   Front-End:
   • Next.js with Typescript: Next.js offers server-side rendering, making it ideal for SEO and performance. Typescript adds static typing for improved code quality and developer productivity.
   • Additional Technologies: Next-Auth for authentication, React Query for caching, and React-toastify for notifications.
   Back-End:
   • Express.js and Node.js: Express.js provides a minimalist framework for building robust web applications with Node.js, offering scalability and flexibility.
   • Database: as the ORM for interacting with the database.
   • Additional Technologies: Stripe for payment processing, (link unavailable) for real-time order updates, and Redis for caching.
   Additional Considerations:
   • Firebase for storage and authentication
   • Git for version control, GitHub for collaborative development
   • Docker for containerization
   • Nginx for web server configuration and load balancing
4. System Design
   [High-level system architecture diagram]
   The front-end interacts with the back-end through RESTful APIs provided by Express.js. User data and restaurant metadata are stored in Firebase. Real-time order updates are facilitated through (link unavailable) Nginx serves as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
5. Implementation Plan
   Phase 1: System Design and Development Environment Setup
   • Set up Next.js with Typescript and Express.js
   • Plan UI mockups and wireframes
   Phase 2: Front-End Development
   • Develop user interface components using Next.js
   • Implement functionalities for user registration, restaurant browsing, and table reservation
   • Integrate Next-Auth for authentication
   Phase 3: Back-End Development
   • Set up Express.js server with Node.js
   • Implement authentication and authorization using Next-Auth
   • Develop endpoints for efficient data retrieval
   • Integrate Prisma for database operations
   • Implement real-time order updates using (link unavailable)
   Phase 4: Integration and Testing
   • Integrate front-end and back-end components
   • Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing
   • Ensure compatibility across devices and browsers
   Phase 5: Deployment
   • Containerize the application using Docker
   • Deploy the application on Firebase Hosting or other suitable hosting platforms
   • Configure Nginx for web server configuration and load balancing
   • Monitor performance and scalability
6. Evaluation Plan
   Functional Testing:
   • Ensure all features work as expected, including user registration, table reservation, food ordering, and order management.
   Usability Testing:
   • Gather feedback from users on the ease of use, navigation, and design of the application.
   Performance Testing:
   • Evaluate loading times, responsiveness, and scalability under different user loads.
   Security Testing:
   • Ensure secure authentication and data encryption measures are in place to protect user data.
   Feedback Collection:
   • Utilize user surveys, A/B testing, and analytics tools to collect and analyze user feedback for continuous improvement.
